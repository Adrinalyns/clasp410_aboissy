    '''
    This code solves the N-layer atmosphere model (with a constant emissivity)
    by resolving the matrix equation AX=b.
    The matrix equation is only a way to unite all the N+1 equations 
    (energy balance for the N layers and the energy balance of Earth's surface)

    Parameters:
    -------------

    n_layers: Integer
        The number of layer of atmosphere in the model

    s0: float, default 1370W/m2
        The solar constant
    
    alpha: float, default to 0.3
        The Earth albedo

    epsilon: float
        the emissivity of the layers (uniform in this model)

    Returns:
    ----------
    t_array: vector of float
        The temperature of Earth's surface in Celsius followed by 
        the Temperature of each layer in Celsius
